<p>  Welcome to Friend! A virtual buddy for those dealing with mental health issues. </p>

<h2>What is Friend?</h2>
<p>Friend is a social network that connects people who are going through the same life, social and mental issues.
   From anxiety to family separation to depression, Friend connects people who have the same issue together so that
   they have someone to talk to. In a moment of crisis, talking to someone who understands you can save a life.</p>

<h2>Connect</h2>
<p>Connect. Users can connect and chat, voice and video chat with others to help them through their tough time.
  Connecting people together is one of the first steps in coping with our issue.</p>

<h3>And</h3>
<p>Our website, Friend, connects to the theme of 'and' because it shows people who suffer from mental illness that
   although they may feel lonely, there is always help and someone that can understand what they are going through.</p>
